The accompanying code implements a heterogeneous auto regression model for projecting market volatility and includes
various metrics about performance etc.  This code has been tested on the OSU flip server.

To run this code...
  1) Make sure that the 5-minute data files for the 18 selected ETFs are included in a 'data' subdirectory within the
     current directory from which you are running the code.  Recent copies of these files may be found in the 'data'
     directory at the following location:  https://github.com/y2carlton/CS467-HAR

  2) PREDICT mode or TEST mode may be selected by setting the 'PREDICT_MODE' constant to 'True' or 'False' respectively.

This code produces all metrics and tables which are included for HAR with the project report.  In commercial use, the
predictions generated by the model would be used to define which ETFs would be traded by the multi-resolution buy/sell
generator, which the sponsor already has.

The goal of this algorithm is to select an asset which will be volatile in the upcoming month.  The buy/sell generator
will be used to determine the timing of actual trades.
